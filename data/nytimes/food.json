Mokyo’s chef, Kyungmin Kay Hyun, is aiming for a very high mark, and hits it far more often than anybody should under these circumstances, when restaurants have their hands full just trying to stay in business for another week.", "Ms. Hyun calls her cooking at Mokyo “Asian-inspired tapas.” My past experience with stuff called Asian tapas has been grim, suggesting that whoever was in charge had never been to a tapas bar and couldn’t find Asia on a globe. Ms. Hyun’s idea of tapas isn’t very Spanish; she means the word in the modern American sense of small, composed plates. But the dishes she lobs out of the kitchen, one quickly following another, make complete sense.", "The texture Ms. Hyun gets out of her Korean fried cauliflower is a marvel, almost fluffy like a baked potato, very soft but not mushy or clammy. Around this is a thin fried shell that keeps its crunch even though it’s coated in a sticky gochujang glaze.", "If this were the Cheesecake Factory, the cauliflower would arrive with a dish of ranch. Because this is Mokyo, it comes drizzled with labneh that incorporates raisins. The surprise of the dish is that the affinity of cauliflower for raisins is so strong it survives the gruff embrace of gochujang.", "Showing off her skill with textures again, Ms. Hyun braises thin tiles of pork jowl for hours and then lightly sears them. You eat them and you immediately think of unagi, an effect she reinforces by brushing the pork with a buttery version of kabayaki sauce, the syrup of soy and mirin that Japanese chefs brush on grilled eel. Each piece of pork is draped over a chunk of chayote, which provides much of the crisp freshness that would be supplied by cucumber if this were a sushi bar.", "Ms. Hyun, known as Kay, opened Mokyo in December with her husband, Sean Hwang. It’s a block away from their first restaurant, ", "Thursday Kitchen", ", and the name is a play on the Korean word for Thursday.", "At both places, Ms. Hyun’s frequent strategy is to rewire familiar dishes; when a dish isn’t already Korean, she adds a component that is. (She comes from South Korea herself, the coastal city of Busan.) A shower of smoked pimentón over exceptionally tender octopus legs at Mokyo give the dish an obvious Spanish cast, but the mesmerizingly good rice porridge under those legs is made with the same technique a Korean cook would use to make jook.", "Mokyo was meant to be a step up in refinement, but the pandemic got in the way. There’s a handsome interior of whitewashed brick, wood floors and industrial-modern chairs, only one-fourth of which can be occupied under current safety rules. At tables set on the sidewalk, and on the pavement from Thursdays to Saturdays, you can still see the servers trying to go through the motions of a somewhat formal service style, even as they are largely drowned out by all the other events on St. Marks, which during one of my meals included a small brass band playing somewhere out of sight.", "Mokyo put together a brief but thoughtful list of sake and soju, but when it reopened for outdoor dining this summer it borrowed a gimmick from Thursday Kitchen: glow-in-the-dark cocktails served in plastic pouches punctured by a straw.", "Over the summer, Ms. Hyun adapted some dishes to stand up to the heat outdoors. Now she is adjusting others so they will keep their heat when the air turns cold. She shortened her menu when she reopened, but she has been adding dishes back and hopes to restore its preplague length soon.", "Whatever changes she has made, though, the food at Mokyo retains a level of complexity and polish that not many restaurants would bother attempting this year.", "The corn dumplings are a successful repurposing of ravioli to deliver the flavors of Mexican grilled corn, in the form of a juicy, butter-laden purée of smoked corn. There is a whisper of truffle oil in the filling, and if the prospect makes you want to run for the hills, you should taste the way the tart and smoldering salsa verde keeps the truffle in its place.", "There are Taiwanese flat noodles dressed with brick-red chile oil that pulses with Sichuan peppercorns. You know this combination, but not what’s coming next: the fresh, reviving, summery aroma of basil leaves and chopped, toasted Brazil nuts. From one wavy strand to the next, the dressing wobbles between dan dan noodles, spaghetti with pesto and some other, delicious thing that until now was found only in Ms. Hyun’s wonderfully busy imagination.", "Follow ", "NYT Food on Twitter", " and ", "NYT Cooking on Instagram", ", ", "Facebook", ", ", "YouTube", " and ", "Pinterest", ".

In the 1990s, middle-class wine lovers could still afford to experience that rite of passage — drinking a truly great wine, not simply to enjoy it, but to understand what qualities made it exceptional in the eyes of history.", "It might have been a splurge, perhaps requiring a few sacrifices. But it was feasible, just as it was possible to buy first-growth Bordeaux, or the top wines of Barolo, Brunello di Montalcino or Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon, to name a few other standard-bearers.", "For example, back in 1994, a bottle of Comte Georges de Vogüé Musigny 1991, a grand cru, retailed for $80 (the equivalent of $141 in 2020, accounting for inflation). Today, that bottle costs about $800.", "In a more extreme case, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti La Tâche 1990, another grand cru and one of the world’s great wines, cost $285 in 1993 ($513 in 2020, accounting for inflation). That’s no small sum then or now, but profoundly curious people might have found a way.", "Today, a bottle of the 2017 La Tâche goes for about $5,000, well out of reach for dedicated students of wine, except for the most wealthy.", "Plenty of other options exist: Village Burgundy rather than grand cru, or any of the many other great wines now being produced around the world. But these bottles, as good as they may be, have not been part of a conversation that has endured for centuries.", "For wine lovers, drinking such renowned bottles would be the equivalent of a college course in Shakespeare, Beethoven or Charlie Parker. In any field, it’s necessary to comprehend the reference points, the benchmarks that connote greatness, to join that conversation even if ultimately you choose to argue the point.", "These days, it is impossible for most people to pay for these wines.", "You could argue that prices have risen on all sorts of consumer goods since then. Why should wine be different? You would not be wrong.", "But the issue is not simply that prices in general have gone up. The prices of top wines have risen at a far steeper rate than the prices of many other luxury goods. La Tâche 2017 is almost 18 times as expensive as the 1990, while a basic Hermès Birkin 30 bag, the grand cru of handbags, has gone from about $3,000 in 1990 to $11,000 in 2020, not quite four times as much.", "Bordeaux operates on a slightly different scale than Burgundy. Far more wine is produced. But it, too, has its ", "benchmark wines", ", and like Burgundy, their prices have skyrocketed.", "Orley Ashenfelter, an economics professor at Princeton University, has closely tracked the Bordeaux market for years. In 1980, the price of a first-growth Bordeaux was roughly four times the price of a fifth-growth Bordeaux, he said in a phone interview, referring to an 1855 classification that ranked top Médoc producers in five tiers, or growths. Nowadays, he said, as prices have risen for all these top wines, the ratio between first- and fifth-growth price is more like 10 to 1.", "What accounts for these disparities?", "Partly it’s the good old law of supply and demand. Great wine is tied to finite pieces of land and to the rhythms of agriculture. With a limited quantity of grapes and only one opportunity to make wine each year, production cannot be increased to meet rising demand.", "With the exception of certain top Champagnes like ", "Dom Pérignon", ", which are not linked to particular vineyards, the best wines are not luxury goods like watches or handbags in which production can grow to meet demand. Nor can production be kept artificially low, for that matter, to create demand.", "Yet even for a trophy wine like Dom Pérignon, the relative price has gone up. A ", "study published in 2017", " in ", "The Journal of Wine Economics", " analyzed Champagne prices in New York City from 1948 to 2013 by determining how many hours people in various income groups would have to work to pay for an entry-level Champagne, a midrange bottle and a flagship or luxury cuvée like Dom Pérignon.", "The study found that the entry-level bottles across income groups required fewer work hours in 2013 than in 1948, but the hours necessary to buy luxury bottles had increased. What’s more, the study found that the work hours required for a top Champagne increased at a much higher rate for the lower income groups relative to the highest, meaning that their access had diminished.", "Thirst for top wines continues to increase exponentially. The audience for these wines was once restricted largely to connoisseurs in Europe, North America and a few other scattered places. It expanded gradually after World War II, encompassing countries like Japan and Australia, and really took off with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the economic opening of China, spurred on by the globalizing effects of the internet.", "Today, wine lovers from around the world clamor for roughly the same pool of great Burgundies that was available in 1990.", "In another example from Bordeaux, Professor Ashenfelter, along with two researchers from the University of Bordeaux, presented a paper in 2018 showing that as income inequality has increased since 1980, the price of first-growth Bordeaux has paralleled the rise in top incomes.", "Though the problem matters to wine lovers, the rising inaccessibility of fancy wines is just a microscopic example of how income inequality and the concentration of wealth in fewer hands have affected daily life.", "I live in Manhattan, where, until the pandemic at least, the price of Manhattan real estate has soared for decades as more people and companies competed for a fixed amount of space. Predictably, Manhattan became harder to afford for small businesses, struggling artists and writers, not to mention civil servants, police officers or firefighters.", "Yet billionaires continue to vie for space. A hedge fund billionaire ", "paid $238 million", " for a new apartment in 2019, in a building constructed only after dozens of middle-class tenants were evicted from their apartments. When billionaires decide that they want something, whether an apartment or a bottle of wine, it drives up prices for everybody else.", "I am admittedly simplifying a complex issue. But thriving mixed neighborhoods have been transformed into luxury ghost towns, as the lifeblood of many communities gave way to grandiose condominiums with absentee owners and chain businesses.", "“In order for income differentials to drive price increases, supply can’t increase,” Professor Ashenfelter said. “That’s the secret of real estate and wine.”", "I don’t want to paint too dire a picture for wine lovers, though. Just as artists and musicians left Manhattan for other parts of New York City, so have many wine lovers had to turn elsewhere for formative experiences.", "Fortunately, great wines are being produced all over the world nowadays. Those who are fascinated by how wine can express in intricate detail the characteristics of a place and culture can turn to ", "German rieslings", ", the chenin blancs of ", "Savennières", ", ", "Chianti Classicos", " and ", "Priorats", ".", "They also have many other less-expensive options, in places like Burgundy and Bordeaux, wines that are highly pleasurable and offer a taste of what the fuss is about, even if they don’t tell the full story.", "The wine areas themselves, or the culture that made the wines what they are, are also vulnerable. Bordeaux is already dominated by corporate ownership, but Burgundy has until recently largely been a region of small farmers. Only in the second half of the 20th century, when more grape-growers began to bottle their own wines instead of selling to large merchants, did some measure of prosperity begin to flow toward the farmers.", "Today, the price of Burgundy has sent land values soaring, threatening the continuity of many small family estates as succession of ownership is confronted with steep inheritance taxes and the natural inclination of some in the next generation to cash in rather than grow grapes.", "This has not occurred on a wide scale yet, but in 2017, in one recent example, ", "Bonneau du Martray,", " which makes exquisite Corton-Charlemagne, a grand cru white Burgundy, ", "was sold to Stan Kroenke", ", an American billionaire, after 200 years of ownership by one family. Mr. Kroenke may turn out to be a fine steward of the property, but the community and culture lose out.", "I’ve spoken to Burgundy producers who grumble about their wines’ going solely into the hands of wealthy collectors, or of investors who will never open them but seek to profit from them as their value rises. These bottles are made to be opened and shared, they will say.", "The producers have little recourse. If they were to sell their wines at lower prices, investors would leap in to buy them and then resell the wines at the market price. The investors, rather than the producers, would pocket the profits, without having to wait years for the bottles to appreciate.", "Diminishing access to great wines is certainly not a catastrophe, or much of a problem for anybody not enamored of wine.

Once in San Francisco, she proceeded, largely by happenstance and almost single-handedly, to bring Chinese cuisine from the chop suey and chow mein era into the more refined one of today, enticing diners with the dishes she ate growing up in her family’s converted Ming-era palace in Beijing.", "The Mandarin, which opened in 1962 as a 65-seat restaurant on Polk Street in the Russian Hill section and later operated on Ghirardelli Square, near Fisherman’s Wharf, offered patrons unheard-of specialties at the time, like potstickers, Chongqing-style spicy dry-shredded beef, peppery Sichuan eggplant, moo shu pork, sizzling rice soup and glacéed bananas.", "This was traditional Mandarin cooking, a catchall term for the dining style of the well-to-do in Beijing, where family chefs prepared local dishes as well as regional specialties from Sichuan, Shanghai and Canton.", "In a profile of Ms. Chiang in 2007, ", "The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that", " her restaurant “defined upscale Chinese dining, introducing customers to Sichuan dishes like kung pao chicken and twice-cooked pork, and to refined preparations like minced squab in lettuce cups; tea-smoked duck; and beggar’s chicken, a whole bird stuffed with dried mushrooms, water chestnuts and ham and baked in clay.”", "The restaurant became a shrine for such food-world luminaries as James Beard, Marion Cunningham and Alice Waters, who said that Ms. Chiang had done for Chinese cuisine what Julia Child had done for the cooking of France.", "That sentiment was echoed by the food magazine ", "Saveur", " in 2000, when it wrote that the Mandarin had “accomplished nothing less than introducing regional Chinese cooking to America.”", "The food scholar Paul Freedman included the Mandarin in his historical survey", " “Ten Restaurants That Changed America” (2016)", ".", "Like Mrs. Child, Ms. Chiang was not a chef, nor was she a likely candidate to run a restaurant. She was born Sun Yun near Shanghai in 1920 — the precise date is unclear — the seventh daughter in a family of nine girls and three boys. Her father, Sun Long Guang, was a French-educated railway engineer who retired at 50 to pursue reading and gardening. Her mother, Sun Shueh Yun Hui, came from a wealthy family that owned textile and flour mills. After her parents died, Sun Yun managed the businesses’ finances while still in her teens.", "The Ming-era palace in which she grew up occupied an entire block in Beijing, where the Chiangs moved in the mid-1920s. Children were not allowed in the kitchen, but she paid close attention on trips to the food markets with her mother and listened carefully as detailed instructions were issued to the cooks.", "After the Japanese occupied Beijing in 1939, the family’s fortunes became precarious. In early 1943, Cecilia, as she was called by her teachers at the Roman Catholic Fu Jen University, left to join relatives in Chongqing.", "In her long journey, much of it by walking, she survived on a few gold coins sewed into her clothes, her only assets after Japanese soldiers had stolen her suitcase.", "In Chongqing she found part-time work as a teacher of Mandarin at the American and Soviet embassies. She also met and married Chiang Liang, whom she had known as an economics professor at Fu Jen University and who was by then a tobacco company executive.", "The couple moved to Shanghai after the war. In 1949, when Communist forces were poised to take over China, Mr. Chiang was offered a diplomatic post in Tokyo at the Nationalist Chinese Mission.", "Two years after arriving in Tokyo, Ms. Chiang opened a Chinese restaurant there, the Forbidden City, with a group of friends. It was an instant success, attracting Chinese expatriates and Japanese diners as well.", "Ms. Chiang sailed to San Francisco in 1960 to help her sister Sun, whose husband had just died. There she met two Chinese acquaintances from Tokyo, women who had recently emigrated to the United States and who wanted to open a restaurant. Ms. Chiang agreed to put up $10,000 as a deposit on a store they had found, on Polk Street, far from the city’s Chinatown.", "When the two women backed out, Ms. Chiang found to her horror that the deposit was not refundable. She took a deep breath and decided to open the restaurant herself rather than tell her husband that she had lost the money.", "“I began to think that if I could create a restaurant with Western-style service and ambience and the dishes that I was most familiar with — the delicious food of northern China — maybe my little restaurant would succeed,” she wrote in the second of her two cookbook memoirs, “The Seventh Daughter: My Culinary Journey from Beijing to San Francisco” (2007, written with Lisa Weiss). The first was “The Mandarin Way” (1974, with Allan Carr).", "Through a newspaper ad, Ms. Chiang found two talented chefs, a married couple from Shandong, and in no time the restaurant was up and running. The early days were difficult. Local suppliers, who all spoke Cantonese, refused to deliver to the Mandarin and would not extend credit. The menu, with 200 dishes, was unmanageable. Ms. Chiang, short on help, scrubbed the kitchen floors herself.", "But little by little, Chinese diners, and a few Americans, came regularly for hot and sour soup and pan-fried potstickers. One evening, ", "Herb Caen", ", the popular columnist for The Chronicle, dined at the restaurant. In a subsequent column, he called it “a little hole-in-the wall” that was serving “some of the best Chinese food east of the Pacific.”", "Overnight the tables filled. Lines formed outside the door. The Mandarin was on its way. In 1968, Ms. Chiang moved the restaurant to larger quarters on Ghirardelli Square, where she could accommodate 300 diners and offer cooking classes.", "In 1975 she opened a second Mandarin, in Beverly Hills, Calif. She sold it to her son, Philip, in 1989. He later helped create the P.F. Chang’s restaurant chain.

But she found that she was always drawn back to the Indonesian food of her youth.", "“Indonesian food became my soul food,” she said.", "Her first cookbook, “", "Coconut & Sambal: Recipes From My Indonesian Kitchen", ",” which Bloomsbury Publishing released in the United States earlier this month, is a culinary expedition through a nation that is usually associated with its beaches and ancient temples, not its remarkable cuisine.

And yes, there are lots of cars, but there’s also all this incredible food that has evolved over generations.”", "In “Coconut & Sambal,” Ms. Lee provides recipes for staples, like gado gado, a salad brimming with steamed vegetables and drizzled in peanut sauce; nasi goreng, or Indonesian fried rice; rendang, slow-cooked meat bathed in coconut milk. But she brings lesser known dishes to the fore, too, like terung balado, spicy baked eggplant; ayam tangkap Aceh, a dish of chicken with curry leaves from Aceh province; and ikan woku blanga, a chile monkfish stew from the city of Manado. The book also includes multiple interpretations of ", "sambal", ", the beloved chile paste.", "Indonesian cuisine is as sensory as it is tropical. When asked what makes this cuisine stand out, Ms. Lee said it’s “the combination of textures, the sounds of the crunch of crispy foods, the balance of salt, sweet, sour, umami and heat and fragrance.”", "Highlighting the variety within the cuisine is her way of refuting the notion that Indonesia can be defined by one city or island. Many people only associate the country with Bali, a popular tourist destination; Ms. Lee was eager to show an Indonesia that truly spanned the archipelago.", "“This book is a tiny slice of what Indonesian cuisine is, which is just incredibly diverse,” she said. “Every region that you go to across thousands of islands has different, distinct flavors.”", "Her introduction to Indonesian cooking began around age 5, when her paternal grandmother, Margaret Thali (called “Popo”), came from West Timor to live with her family in Australia. (Coralie Agung, Ms. Lee’s mother, is Australian, and Ms. Lee was born in Sydney.) Her grandmother prepared dishes like roasted Balinese chicken, gado gado and rendang while a young Ms. Lee watched. Eating her grandmother’s peanut sauce was one of her first memories of Indonesian food, she said.", "“After going to the pool, my mom would buy us these sausage rolls, and we’d have them with the peanut sauce,” she said. “It really represented the marriage of an Australian woman to an Indonesian man, which of course defined my childhood.”", "When Ms. Lee moved to London in 2011, she was startled to find only two Indonesian restaurants in the entire city at the time.", "“I really felt the absence of being able to eat Indonesian food, or have Indonesian food that my aunties have cooked,” she said.", "During a trip to Indonesia to visit family in 2016, she unearthed recipe books that her grandmother had handwritten — an odd discovery because recipes there were traditionally passed down orally. Those recipes provided the inspiration for “Coconut & Sambal.”", "“I spent a lot of time at my aunties’ cooking dishes together that belonged to my grandmother,” she said.", "Ms. Lee spent about six months researching recipes in Indonesia, journeying to places like Sumatra, in the west, and Timor, in the east.

More likely, it’s a main course and a green salad. Sometimes, it is a one-pot main course, though not always. (I find that even when cooking a simple meal, at least two pots and pans are often involved.) And, quite frequently, dinner is meatless.", "While I consider myself a carnivore, my first love will always be vegetables. I’m quite happy to have a vegetarian meal several times a week.", "In addition to fresh vegetables, whole grains and dried legumes are usually part of the picture. I’m a big fan of every type of bean, whether cannellini or garbanzo, with a cupboard full of them to choose from. Lately, it is lentils that most strike my fancy. Aside from being delicious, they have the advantage of being quick-cooking. It usually takes no more than 30 minutes to simmer a pot, so they are perfect for a relatively fast meal.", "For most uses, any kind will work, but even among lentils, there are lots of types to choose from. If the meal is leaning in a Spanish direction, I might go with Pardina lentils, a small brown variety good for stews, soups or salads. For an Italianate dish, I like Castelluccio lentils from Umbria. When I want to veer toward Turkish flavors, I choose split red lentils.", "What follows are three lentil dinners I highly recommend. They are all vegetarian, and all have the advantage of tasting good, perhaps better, when prepared in advance. Lastly, each of these dishes can benefit from a drizzle of fruity extra-virgin olive oil as a final flourish, to make them that much more luscious.", "This rustic stew improves after a day in the fridge. At the very least, try to cook it an hour or two ahead of the meal, so the elements have time to meld. (You can also make it to eat over several days, or to freeze for later.) Any size green or brown lentil will work here, if you can’t get the small Spanish Pardina lentils (or French lentilles du Puy). But the smoky pimentón is vital: Along with extra-virgin olive oil, it provides real depth of flavor.", "There are many versions of pasta with lentils, a multitude of which are thick and stewlike, more lentil than pasta. This one emphasizes the pasta. The saucy lentil topping is similar to a traditional Bolognese ragù. The addition of fennel — seeds, bulb and chopped green fronds — gives it a surprising brightness and zest. For even more flavor, put your saved-up Parmesan rinds to use in the sauce. (Meat eaters: Add a little chopped anchovy or Italian fennel sausage.)", "You may have encountered the kind of vegetarian lentil loaf that masquerades as something else. With its brownish-grey color and a red ketchup glaze, it tries to emulate the homespun comfort of meatloaf. Most recipes call for Worcestershire and barbecue sauce to make it taste beefy. This delicate red lentil loaf is worlds away from that. It’s all about the undisguised flavor of the lentil: sweet and vegetal. The seasoning is a little bit Turkish, with lemon, cumin, cilantro, dill and yogurt. It is delicious served at room temperature or warm. The loaf is easier to cut if cooled, with slices heated through in the oven. Even better is to griddle the slices with a little oil in a nonstick or cast-iron pan until crisp and golden on both sides.", "The earthy, smoky flavors in this lentil stew send me on a beeline to the Northern Rhône Valley of France, ancestral home of the syrah grape, which with its peppery, savory flavors will be an excellent complement to this dish. Look for St.-Joseph, Crozes-Hermitage or a midaged Cornas, coincidentally just what we drank in ", "Wine School", " recently. You could also try syrahs from California or Australia, as long as they are made in a restrained style. Other red options? You could drink a new-wave grenache, like those coming from the Sierra de Gredos region of Spain, or an aglianico from Campania, as long as it’s not too tannic. Or if you want a white, I think this dish would go really well with a good chenin blanc.

But at the hotel, Ms. Anderson was taken aback to find only one room, with one bed. On the way to dinner, she said, Mr. Kruth told her that he and his wife had an open relationship, that he had had a “passionate” affair with Ms. James, and that sex between master sommeliers and candidates was common.

She had been warned not to be alone with him, she said, but he seemed respectful during pretrip text exchanges.", "On the trip, she said, he repeatedly angled to get her away from the group and into her hotel room. Eventually, they had sex. “I thought it would appease him and he would go away,” she said. She was angry, she said, but not surprised.", "“The sad thing is that you get used to being beholden to men in this industry,” Ms. James said. “I felt like I didn’t have a choice.”", "About a year later, she said, Mr. Kruth offered to write a recommendation letter she needed to proceed to the next exam if she would meet him for sex at a court event in Austin, Texas. She did. “I got off the waiting list the next day,” she said. “I felt dirty and terrible, and that was the end of the court for me.”", "Through a lawyer, Mr. Kruth said he believed that all the sexual encounters the women described were consensual, and that many of the women remained on good terms with him; he was invited to Ms. James’s and Ms. Lopes’s subsequent weddings. He also said he did not give special treatment to women with whom he had sexual contact.", "A spokeswoman for the court said that the board issued a “letter of warning” to Mr. Kruth in 2017 after investigating two formal complaints about sexual misconduct, and that he is barred from court programming and upper-level examinations.", "Mr. Kruth is not the only high-ranking master sommelier accused of sexually inappropriate behavior by multiple women.", "Robert Bath, a professor of wine at the Culinary Institute of America, is a longtime board member and former vice chairman.

As she headed to her room after a late-night group swim, she said, Mr. Hendricks intercepted her in an empty lobby and grabbed for her breasts. She pushed him away, horrified.", "“What I remember after that is white-hot rage,” she said. But Ms. Ayala, 33, didn’t tell anyone in the industry what Mr. Hendricks, 54, had done. “People sat at his feet,” she said. “I was sitting for the certified-somm exam, and I was worried that I wouldn’t be allowed to if I rocked the boat.”", "Courtney Keeling, a sommelier in Dallas who said she had met Mr. Hendricks several times and had just chatted with him about his wife and children, offered him a spot on her couch after a 2018 event because she feared he was too drunk to drive.

He recused himself from the decision, and left the board soon afterward.", "In an email, Mr. Stamp, 43, said he had resigned; the court’s representative said he left by “mutual agreement” as part of a disciplinary action stemming from his failure to disclose the relationships. He is currently barred from all court programming and examinations.", "“I prefer not to discuss my romantic relationships as a matter of privacy,” Mr. Stamp wrote.", "In June, the board stalled on making any public acknowledgment of the killing of George Floyd. In internal forums, members were roughly divided between the old guard, who felt that sommeliers should stay out of politics, and younger members who were furious that the court wouldn’t express support for its Black members and racial justice.", "On June 22, the board made a statement, announcing a new committee on diversity and inclusion. The court’s posts on social media immediately began to showcase women and people of color in the organization.", "That did not sit well with Ms. Mitchell, who then decided to come forward about sexual misconduct in the court. “They do not get to use us as P.R. when we have been subjected to so much misogyny, put up with so many unwanted touches and stares and invitations to get where we are,” she said.", "For Ms. Thompson, the Dallas wine director, inclusion is a life-or-death matter for the industry.", "“We need more people of all kinds to love wine,” she said. “White Claw is going to eat us all if we don’t change.”", "Follow ", "NYT Food on Twitter", " and ", "NYT Cooking on Instagram", ", ", "Facebook", ", ", "YouTube", " and ", "Pinterest", ".

The most obvious effect, happening now and getting worse by the week but already dismal to contemplate, will be the death of hundreds and possibly thousands of small, independent businesses, each loss radiating out to employees, communities and suppliers many miles away. The crisis is so immediate and overwhelming that it is hard to imagine what life will be like after it’s over.", "But when the pandemic is under control and restrictions on dining have been lifted, at least one emergency measure will remain. The outdoor dining program that allowed ", "more than 10,000 restaurants", " to set out tables and chairs on the city’s sidewalks and streets is ", "here to stay", ", according to Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council.", "In the general calamity, it’s been easy to overlook the enormous implications this move will have for restaurants, streets and neighborhoods. It’s not too soon to start making a few predictions about a city whose character will be shaped as much by the umbrellas and chairs at ground level as it is by the lights and spires of its skyline.", "Restaurants won’t just be serving outdoors; they’ll also be assembling food and perhaps cooking it, to whatever extent the Fire Department allows. Already this summer and fall, the scent of smoke and Scotch bonnet peppers has filled the air in Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, as Jamaican cooks prepare jerk chicken in barrel smokers on corners and in parking lots. Soon every Mexican restaurant will want its own sidewalk taco cart, every izakaya its own open-air hibachi, every seafood house a spread of oysters and clams on ice to lure passers-by.", "With a few exceptions, the city’s restaurants have traditionally favored quiet, discreet, even coy exteriors. This is all about to change as the industry conducts a large-scale experiment in capturing the attention of pedestrians. Remember the ", "inflatable pink flamingoes", " in the middle of Seventh Avenue? They may have been lonely at first, but soon they will feel very much at home as pool toys, thatched umbrellas, palm trees and other items associated with spring break become regular features of New York street life. It won’t just be tiki-adjacent décor, though. Will flashing lights bring in customers? What about ", "those “waving their arms” tube puppets", " that used-car dealers love? We’ll find out.", "Last week, I ate at a table placed on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, several blocks of which are closed to traffic on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. After my veal Parm and spaghetti arrived, a gentleman rode a bicycle along the avenue. On the handlebars, he’d balanced a jukebox playing Tony Bennett. Can the strolling accordionists be far behind? Since the outdoor dining program started in June, musicians have been playing for tips. Tomi Jazz, the Japanese jazz bar in Midtown, moved its entire operation outside to a shack built on East 53rd Street where small combos play quietly every non-rainy night. Tilt your head, squint your eyes and you can see the glimmer of a New York where street music is as deeply woven into street life as it is in New Orleans.", "A lawyer would say that musicians are allowed play in public, without amplification, anywhere they like. A New Yorker would say, “Good luck with that.” Already, restaurants are fielding complaints from neighbors who apparently have no room in their hearts for music. Joshua Jennings, a jazz trumpeter who played several nights this summer on Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village, said it was one of his favorite locations until a few people who live there began threatening to have the city revoke the block’s permission to close itself to traffic and place tables in the street. Before it came to that, a restaurateur on the block politely asked them to find somewhere else to play. (Mr. Jennings says they’ll be outside ", "Da Toscano", " on Minetta Lane this weekend, weather permitting.)", "A lot more people live above outdoor dining areas than did a year ago. Neighbors will say that sidewalk and street seating draw not only jazz musicians but also rats, panhandlers and out-of-control bachelorette parties. In our grid of grievances, this means that some restaurants are going to have to fight off attacks on their ability to operate outdoors. Liquor licenses will be the first targets. Privilege will assert itself. I hope restaurants can follow the rules and then stand their ground. They add more to the city’s culture than the parked cars they’ve displaced.", "Citi Bike stations in the pavement were a start, but they didn’t seem truly ours, partly because of the corporate branding. But once you’ve gotten used to enjoying dinner and a cocktail on a patch of blacktop that would otherwise be taken up by a RAV4, you begin to wonder what else could sit in the street. Some cities have given parking spaces to shared trash bins so leaking garbage bags no longer sprawl on the sidewalks. What about community gardens? Meditation classes? Soccer match broadcasts? Desks with outlets and Wi-Fi for the permanently WFH? More tables and chairs set aside for people who can’t afford a restaurant meal?", "Calls across the country to “defund the police” have led to new interest in other ways of keeping streets safe. A block with a popular outdoor dining area could be a less appealing site for street crime. “As we’re talking about reforms to policing — when you have more people, when you don’t have abandoned places, there’s more safety,” said Michael Kodransky, the global research manager of the nonprofit ", "Institute for Transportation & Development Policy", ". “That’s the theory of eyes on the street,” he said, citing an idea laid out by ", "Jane Jacobs", " in her 1961 book ", "“The Death and Life of Great American Cities.”", "Restaurants and bars with significant sidewalk and street frontage will see a dramatic increase in overall seating once indoor dining is back in full swing. The city is providing the outdoor space free of charge, but many storefront owners won’t be as generous. Most of them are too worried about collecting any rent at all to be focused on how much they might charge a year from now, said Michael A. Tortorici, a partner at the real estate brokerage ", "Ariel Property Advisors", ". After the state of emergency ends, the fairly lawless world of outdoor dining will be more strictly regulated in ways that will affect restaurant earnings. “It’s very hard to predict right now” how rents will respond, he said. “But revenue sharing is something people are talking a lot about these days.”", "The stripped-down, nearly instant approval process that allows restaurants to set up sidewalk and street seating turned out to be far more fair than the complicated and expensive former system for getting sidewalk dining permits. A 15-seat Nigerian restaurant in the South Bronx is almost as likely to clear the regulatory hurdles as the trattoria on Madison Avenue charging $40 for a plate of ravioli. But we won’t be in a state of emergency forever. New regulations are coming to keep bus and bike lanes safe, and to make sure that outdoor dining is accessible to people with disabilities, Polly Trottenberg, the commissioner of the Department of Transportation, told members of the City Council in September.", "Still, it will be a great loss if the system is recomplicated so much that restaurateurs again need to hire a lawyer, an architect and an expediter to get permits. The whole city has benefited by encouraging restaurants of all sorts, from the most well-off to the leanest and scrappiest, to lend their own flavor to public spaces.

Just like other Mexicans who aren’t from Piedras, I was puzzled when anyone called them Mexican.", "Now that I’ve lived in the United States for more than two decades, I’ve begun to grasp why they defy categorization. Mexican? American? Tex-Mex? Nachos are the epitome of comida fronteriza, food from the borderlands. It’s a place where foods seem caught in a constantly evolving in-between: not from here, not from there, strongly rooted but hard to pin down.", "“Not Tex-Mex, Pati,” said Adán Medrano, a chef and an authority on the food of Southern Texas and Northeast Mexico, ", "which he refers to as Texas Mexican food", ". “The original nachos are Mexican through and through, and have little to do with those. I mean, enough with the cheese!”", "All those nachos I’d been eating, including the superlayered ones from Tex-Mex restaurants in San Antonio, were neither the only kinds nor the originals.", "Nachos were born in 1940 when, as the story goes, a group of women walked into the Victory Club in Piedras outside business hours. But Ignacio Anaya, the maître d’hôtel, had no cooks in the kitchen. Mr. Anaya was known as Nacho, the traditional nickname for anyone named Ignacio in Spanish-speaking countries.", "The wives of Americans stationed at a military base in Eagle Pass, Texas, the women had crossed the Rio Grande to shop and were looking for a drink and a bite. Aiming to please, Mr. Anaya ran to the kitchen and made a quick appetizer with ingredients he found. He topped totopos, fried corn tortilla chips, with Colby cheese and slices of pickled jalapeños, and threw them in the oven.", "The women loved it so much they asked for seconds, and jokingly ended up calling them Nacho’s special. The dish became an essential part of the Victory Club menu, and a fixture on others in the region. Eventually, Mr. Anaya moved to Eagle Pass and opened a restaurant called Nacho’s.", "“Nachos were created in a restaurant of mainly comida casera, the foods that Mexican-American families were eating at the time,” Mr. Medrano said. They are essentially open-faced quesadillas — a very quick meal that’s whipped up in Mexican homes — but made crunchy and bite-size, with Colby cheese.", "Colby was widely used in the region during World War II, when nachos were created, said Dr. Adalberto Peña de los Santos, the director of the International Nacho Festival, which is usually held in October on the banks of the Rio Grande. It was a time of hardship on both sides of the border.", "“In Piedras, we used to call Colby ‘queso relief,’” he said. “It was one of the ingredients provided by the U.S. government.” People who received the cheese on the American side of the border would share, sell or barter with relatives on the Mexican side.", "Dr. Peña de los Santos said it was fitting that the signature dish from the region includes an American cheese and was first eaten by Americans: It shows how fluid the food and culture of the region are, routinely blurring the border.", "“When the geopolitical border came, it divided the community and the families, but not in every way,” Mr. Medrano said. “We have been living and eating this shared and coherent culinary reality for thousands of years.”", "Just as American ingredients were making their way into Texas Mexican foods, Texas Mexican foods were being adapted and served as Tex-Mex — “by Anglos to please Anglos,” he said.", "Tex-Mex restaurants made nachos an essential part of the menu, baptizing the chips with all of the fixings their customers had come to expect: cooked ground meat, sour cream, table salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole and pickled jalapeños. With more versions came more layers, as carne asada, black olives, shredded Cheddar cheese, beans and corn were added to the dish.", "It was Frank Liberto, a businessman from Texas, who took nachos to the masses in the 1970s. Two inventions made this possible: an emulsified cheese sauce that requires no refrigeration, has an extended shelf life and stays melted without heat, and a pump for the cheese so the nachos could be assembled as fast as people could order them.", "Mr. Liberto introduced ballpark nachos in 1976 at a Texas Rangers baseball game, then in 1977 at a Dallas Cowboys football game. From there, they appeared at stadiums and movie theaters throughout the United States, and then one country after another.", "You can find all sorts of nachos at the International Nacho Festival, Dr. Peña de los Santos said, styles that reflect trends throughout America and the borderlands, from the original recipe to nachos topped with carne asada, or pulled pork, or bulgogi. There are some with just one cheese, others with many cheeses. Many stick to pickled jalapeños.", "According to festival guidelines, there are three things nachos must have: tortilla chips, copious amounts of melted cheese and some kind of chile. I would add that nachos need to be messy, saucy and provoke that “I can’t have just one” feeling when you take a bite.", "You can be charmed with the honesty, simplicity and irresistible clash of flavors in the original nacho recipe: the barely salted tortilla chips, the nutty cheese with a slight bitter bite and the briny taste of the punchy jalapeños. Or you can have your fill of outrageous and over-the-top Tex-Mex versions, or top the chips with anything else you crave.", "And even someone from Piedras like Mr. Perret, whose family has been there since the mid-1800s, loves a good ballpark nacho. The last time he made nachos for friends, for a Super Bowl party in February, he mixed Velveeta with milk to make something that resembled that ballpark nacho cheese, then topped the tortilla chips with chilorio — the adobo-seasoned pulled pork dish from Sinaloa — and pickled jalapeños.", "“I couldn’t watch the game in peace,” he said. “My friends couldn’t get enough, and had me making batch after batch.”", "Recipes: ", "The Original Nachos", " | ", "Hearty Bean Nachos With Spicy Salsa", " | ", "Homemade Tortilla Chips", " | ", "Bricklayer-Style Nachos", " | ", "Pickled Jalapeños", "Follow ", "NYT Food on Twitter", " and ", "NYT Cooking on Instagram", ", ", "Facebook", ", ", "YouTube", " and ", "Pinterest", ".

Mofongo is intensely flavorful and satisfying, and remains one of the most popular dishes on the island.", "Then there’s arroz con pollo: rice and chicken, the island’s ultimate comfort food. A dish that does a lot with very little, it starts with chicken sautéed in sofrito, a blend of garlic, onions, peppers and recao or culantro, an earthy cousin of cilantro that thrives on the island. The chicken is then cooked in stock with rice — also brought to the island by the Spanish and cultivated by enslaved African and Indigenous workers — along with whatever other ingredients are on hand.

Onions and peppers and aromatics like cilantro — it’s amazing how you can use basic humble ingredients to make food that just really shines.”", "For decades, hurricane recovery has led Puerto Rican cooks to rely on imported nonperishable goods even more than they already do — a legacy of U.S. policy.

They’ve been squeezed, to put it bluntly.”", "Law enforcement officials say they are combating tax avoidance and counterfeit and unsanitary production, which are indeed problems in Russia. Recent changes in the law are supposed to make it easier for small wineries to be legal.", "But Mr. Minasov calculates that wineries still need to produce at least 40,000 bottles a year just to cover the expense — $6,000 at a minimum — of getting licensed and, more problematically, of keeping up with the reams of building regulations and reporting requirements. He added that he believes small-scale wineries should not be required to be licensed at all, “but they don’t listen to us up above.”", "On a hillside by the sea, Ivan Karakezidi, a descendant of Greeks who goes by Yannis, was on the phone with yet another lawyer.
